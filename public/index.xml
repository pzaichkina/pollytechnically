        <description>&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, I like to give myself a little emotional hug by calling myself a professional author. Although technically (ha!) it is true, my average day at work is not what I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager composing angsty poetry, I thought a writer rolled out of bed, had their coffee, then switched on their computer and their inspiration, and just &lt;em&gt;wrote&lt;/em&gt;. All day, maybe with some comfort breaks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
